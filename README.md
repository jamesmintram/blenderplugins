# blenderplugins

Notes for me, so I don't have to figure this stuff out again.
Clone this into:

```
~/Library/Application Support/Blender/{Version}/scripts/addons
```

For lazyness:

```
  git clone https://github.com/jamesmintram/blenderplugins.git ~/Library/Application Support/Blender/2.75/scripts/addons
```
